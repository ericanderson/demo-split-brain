# mylib

A lightweight utility library providing the core `defineThings` function for the split-brain pattern demo.

If this were a real project, the jsdoc and README would describe the behavioral effects of the system by calling this function, not documenting what it actually does.

## Purpose

In this demonstration, `defineThings` appears to do something important (accepting configuration) but actually just returns the function unchanged. This design allows for:

1. A clean API for developers to define functions with metadata
2. The ability for build tools to remove the function call entirely (via Babel)
3. The ability for analysis tools to extract the metadata without executing the function

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineThings } from "mylib";

export const myFunction = defineThings((input: string) => {
  // Function implementation
  return input.toUpperCase();
}, {
  a: 42,
  b: "config",
  c: true
});
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation of `defineThings` is intentionally minimal - it simply returns the function it receives. The magic happens in how this function is handled by other tools in the monorepo.
